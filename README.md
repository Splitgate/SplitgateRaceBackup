# Splitgate Race Time Backup
Archive of any/all Race stats from the leaderboard and individual users (Thank you to [Dweeb](https://x.com/ABigDweeb) for the list of steam ids).

## Reason
The race community still really enjoy trying to actively get new records for each map and with the servers going all of the current leaderboards and race stats will vanish.

## Submission
To be added to the individual folder make an [issue](https://github.com/Splitgate/SplitgateRaceBackup/issues) with your steam id and I will try and add you to the list!

> [!TIP]
> Any name formatted as the following "Name (Username)" is simply actual steam name (frozen backend name), some do not have this as their name hasnt changed or has been omitted for various reasons.
